### Hi there 👋

🔭 I recently attended a web-development bootcamp at Le Wagon, Amsterdam.<br>
🌱 I've been working on projects in Ruby on Rails. <a href="http://www.ecolympians.fun/">Ecolympians</a> and <a href="https://toys4rent.herokuapp.com/">Toys4rent </a>took shape as part of the bootcamp course.<br>
⚡  I'm currently learning React<br>
📫 How to reach me: preiyah@gmail.com<br>
✍️  I blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@preiyah">Medium</a> sometimes<br>

Currently, I'm looking for job openings in web dev.
